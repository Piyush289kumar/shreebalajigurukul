# Project Name: PHP Local Project

## Overview

This README file provides the steps necessary to set up and run a PHP project locally on your computer using XAMPP. The project includes a MySQL database with the necessary schema and data located in the `db` directory. 

## Prerequisites

1. **XAMPP**: Ensure you have XAMPP installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Start XAMPP

1. Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

### Step 2: Configure the Project

1. **Download or Clone the Project**: Ensure you have the project files on your local machine.
2. **Move Project to XAMPP Directory**:
    - Copy the project folder to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. This is typically located at `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

### Step 3: Import the Database

1. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
2. Create a new database:
    - Click on the **New** button in the left sidebar.
    - Enter a name for your database (e.g., `my_database`) and click **Create**.
3. Import the database file:
    - Select the newly created database from the left sidebar.
    - Click on the **Import** tab.
    - Click **Choose File** and select the SQL file located in the `db` directory of your project (e.g., `db/my_database.sql`).
    - Click **Go** to import the database.

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
2. Locate the configuration file where database connection settings are defined (e.g., `config.php`, `db_config.php`, or similar).
3. Ensure the database settings match the following:

```php
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', ''); // Leave blank if using the default XAMPP setup
define('DB_NAME', 'my_database'); // Replace with your database name
```

### Step 5: Run the Project

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost/your_project_folder](http://localhost/your_project_folder), replacing `your_project_folder` with the name of your project directory.

### Step 6: Login to the Application

Use the following credentials to log in:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `123`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure XAMPP's Apache and MySQL services are running.
- Verify that the project files are correctly placed in the `htdocs` directory.
- Double-check database connection settings in your configuration file.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the XAMPP FAQs and documentation available on the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/faq.html).
